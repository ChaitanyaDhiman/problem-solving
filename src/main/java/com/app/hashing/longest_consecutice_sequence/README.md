<h2><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/longest-consecutive-subsequence/">Longest Consecutive Subsequence</a></h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen' alt='Difficulty: Easy' /><hr><p>Given an array of integers, the task is to find the length of the longest subsequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order. </p>


<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> arr[] = [2, 6, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest consecutive subsequence [2, 6, 1, 4, 5, 3].
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [1,1,1,2,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The subsequence [1, 2,3] is the longest subsequence of consecutive elements
